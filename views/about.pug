            |Hi, I am Karina and I am from Kazakhstan. I worked for Shell oil and gas company for the past 5 years, and in my last role as a Commercial Analyst I was working on a 50MW solar project.

            |Following my recent move to the US, I decided it is the time to pursue a new career and become a Fullstack JavaScript Developer. This decision came after serious and prolonged consideration. I know itâ€™s a competitive field, but I was always excited about IT industry and building software. Tackling challenges of code writing and ability to see the results are among many things that appeal to me.

            |Overall I have 9+ years of experience. Throughout these years I was able to develop many useful skills and was highly regarded for being committed, consistently taking ownership and delivering the goals. I believe my previous experience combined with my determination will serve a solid ground for the new launch.
